## TODO
### Known bugs
- [ ] Adding or removing lots of pieces screw up the maxscore count on artists progression
- [ ] Popups are not shown when clicking on circles on map
- [ ] Search for pieces does not work on Artist Component
- [x] (should be fixed) Leaflet "Cannot remove of undefined" occurring randomly

### Priority 1
- [ ] Allow admins to add artists
- [ ] Allow admins to remove artists
- [ ] Allow admins to mark artists as published/unpublished
- [x] Allow users to delete all their data

### Priority 2
- [ ] Use Cypress to test all processes (see how to mock data into/out of Firestore)
- [ ] Allow users to reset their password
- [ ] Better way to see vanished pieces
- [x] Itineraries should go to randomized location when using circles.

### Priority 3
- [ ] Ask for geolocation only when needed
- [ ] Make the app core functionalities work offline (dashboard progression)
