## TODO
### Known bugs
- [ ] Leaflet "Cannot remove of undefined" occurring randomly
- [ ] Adding or removing lots of pieces screw up the maxscore count on artists progression

### Priority 1
- [ ] Allow users to delete all their data
- [ ] Allow admins to add artists
- [ ] Allow admins to remove artists
- [ ] Allow admins to mark artists as published/unpublished

### Priority 2
- [ ] Use Cypress to test all processes (see how to mock data into/out of Firestore)
- [ ] Allow users to reset their password
- [ ] Better way to see vanished pieces

### Priority 3
- [ ] Ask for geolocation only when needed
- [ ] Make the app core functionalities work offline (dashboard progression)
